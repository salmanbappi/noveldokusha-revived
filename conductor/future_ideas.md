# Future Ideas & Roadmap

## AI-Powered Immersive Reading
- [ ] **Smart Content Cleaning:** Use Gemini to remove "Author's Notes", ads, and social media links from scraped content.
- [ ] **Mood-Based Ambience:** Analyze chapter text using Gemini to select background ambient sounds (rain, tavern, battle, forest).
- [ ] **Chapter Summaries:** Add a "TL;DR" button to get a quick summary of a chapter.

## Enhanced TTS (Gemini Narrator)
- [ ] **Gemini Audio Modality:** Fully implement `GeminiTextToSpeechManager` using Gemini 2.5 Flash for high-quality, expressive narration.
- [ ] **Character Voices:** Use Gemini to identify character dialogue and assign different voices/tones to them.

## Scraper Resilience (Source Revival)
- [ ] **Self-Healing Scrapers:** Implement a script that uses Gemini to repair broken CSS selectors by analyzing fresh HTML.
- [ ] **Automatic Source Generation:** A tool to create new source implementations just by providing the URL.
- [ ] **Cloudflare Evasion:** Explore WebView-based scraping or headless browsers for protected sites.

## UX Improvements
- [ ] **Compose Migration:** Continue migrating XML views to Jetpack Compose for better performance and Material 3 support.
- [ ] **Offline EPUB Reader:** Improve the local source to support more EPUB features (table of contents, styling).
